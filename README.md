# **Project NNN - Nebula Nature Notes** üé∂üåç

## **Summary**
To reveal the theme of the challenge, our team decided to use the power of **music art**. We were inspired by the experience of **opera houses** that create eco-operas and sets from recycled materials. The concept of our musical piece aims to **touch the hearts** of people who love art but have not often thought about the connection between different systems on Earth.

Our storytelling is based on **NASA data**. While researching the resources, we discovered the interconnectedness of such things as **fast fashion**, **ocean pollution**, **climate change**, **worsening living conditions** in developing countries, and **geopolitical conflicts**.

Our opera will be divided into several **acts** that reflect each of these systems. To demonstrate the connection between these systems and the impact of humans, the plot of our opera has **branches**. This makes our audiovisual product **interactive**, as different choices of the viewer will affect the ending, just as it happens in real life.

Now we are introducing you to the **concept of the opera**. To convey the atmosphere of the project, we used modern content generation tools. Two key arias and musical transitions written by our concept author are now fully ready.

We want to share a **bright emotional experience** with the audience. We dream that our project will be physically realized, and not just exist as an interactive web series.

## **Inspiration & Research** üî≠
NASA's research inspired us to create the plot of the opera concept. We were impressed by certain data, so we decided to show it in the form of musical compositions.

**_Join us on this musical journey to explore the interconnection of Earth's systems and the impact of human activities._**
